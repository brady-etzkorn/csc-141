'''As my programming skills continue to grow, I have ideas to use my coding to make platform game 
as well as an open world game like minecraft since those are my two different types of games. I think it would 
be interesting to see how this could be done through coding and I want to learn everything there is to be done
to make any types of games through python and continue that to other languages of code as I still progress my programming. '''
