'''The basis of PEP 8 are the coding guidelines for the new versions of Python. 
The style that it talks about is a universal way for programmers to write there code from now on.
Some of the big things that PEP 8 focuded on being to use indent instead of space, you should be using 4 spaces.
It also focused on how to use these types of indentations and how to line up your code to make it as neat as possible.
Another big thing talked about in PEP 8 was the use of blank lines, you should be using blank lines to break up groups of code, 
if the code goes together like in a loop or list it should be separated correctly with blank lines.
Towards the end it mentions things like comments and how to use them affectively as well as the use of naming conventions.
Naming conventions was a big section of PEP 8 telling you all the dos and donts of naming things within your code.
Overall PEP 8 is just a guideline/list that tells you everyway to make your code more readable for the people that have to read it, 
and help you get used to this format of coding.'''
