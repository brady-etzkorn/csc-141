If I had infinite skills:
I would like the ability to make games that people love and would want to become a big name in the gaming community.
While working up to that I would like to be able to make good enough code to make myself a living that I enjoy and love.
I would want to be able to give back to the gaming community by being able to code some amazing games that are interesting for the players.
