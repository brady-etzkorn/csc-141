#Reflecting back to other programming experiences that I have had I think they will help me get by in this class.
#I had taken an online computer science course in high school and had learned all the basics of coding, like how to print and use variables.
#I think that knowing this will help me move quickly through this course and help me learn a deeper understanding of coding.
#As well as eventually help me get to what I want to do with my coding/programming ability and be able to program games and get a career in this.
