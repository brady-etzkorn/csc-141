#doing python.org assignment 
#After looking through the python website it is broken up into different sections.
#There were sections for python news and python events. But the ones that had stuck out to me the most were the tabs that showed everything python is used for.
#It goes on to talk about how python is used for things like website developing, software development, education, and scientific matter. 
#The other section that had stuck out to me was the section talking about success stories, this section when hovering over it would give you a drop down menu with all the categories that python has been successful in. 
#It also has a section where it can show you jobs that you can get for knowing how to use python, and get work for what you are able to do.
#Overall the python website gives you a lot more insight into what python can do for you if you stick with it and become good at coding. It shows you possible futures for yourself.
