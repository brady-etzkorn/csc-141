#doing python.org assignment 

'''
After looking through the python website it is broken up into different sections.
The main section that had stuck out to me was the section about success stories, it was strictly just a folder about how python has been successful in different fields.
What really stuck out to me from this section was the software development part, since it is something I'm looking to go get a career in. 
Once clicking on thr software development page, a health care story jumped out at me. It had talked about the story of the company and what their goals were, and then what they had used python for. 
In the end they used python to make an automated appointment scheduling and requestin server as well as online consultations. 
This seemed to me like a huge deal for the world of coding and health care, and makes me excited for possible things that I could do with coding in my future.
