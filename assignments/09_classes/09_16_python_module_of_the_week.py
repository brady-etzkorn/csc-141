'''The module that had stuck out to me was called clock time. It seemed interesting just by the name
because I had wanted to see how a program was able to print time and dates. Going into the code
it was amazing and interesting to see all the compenents that it had taken to print time and the month 
and day. It was able to get things like milliseconds as well. Definitely one of the more interesting 
modules.'''
